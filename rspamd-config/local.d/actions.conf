# Telegram Bot Actions
# Map standard Rspamd actions to Telegram bot actions

# Use standard Rspamd actions that the bot can map to its own actions
# The bot will map these actions to its internal actions:
# - add_header (score 5.0) -> tg_warn
# - greylist (score 10.0) -> tg_delete  
# - reject (score 15.0) -> tg_ban
# - reject (score 20.0) -> tg_perm_ban

# Override the default action thresholds for Telegram bot
# Note: The bot code checks for score >= 20.0 for permanent ban
add_header = 5.0;
greylist = 10.0;
reject = 15.0;
