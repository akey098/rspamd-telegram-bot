  LEGACY TELEGRAM RULES - DISABLED
  
  This monolithic version has been superseded by the modular
  implementation located in `lua.local.d/telegram/` directory.
  
  To use the new modular structure, load `telegram_modular.lua` instead:
  
  require "lua.local.d.telegram_modular"
  
  The modular structure provides:
  - Better organization by functional area
  - Easier maintenance and extension
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Centralized configuration
  
  See telegram/README.md for detailed documentation.
